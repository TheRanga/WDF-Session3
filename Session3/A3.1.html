            <h1> Web Development</h1>
            <p>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet 
                (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing 
                the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications 
                (or just 'web apps') electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list 
                of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web 
                content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network 
                security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" 
                usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. 
                Most recently Web development has come to mean the creation of content management systems or CMS. 
                These CMS can be made from scratch, proprietary or open source. In broad terms the CMS acts as 
                middleware between the database and the user through the browser. A principle benefit of a CMS 
                is that it allows non-technical people to make changes to their web site without having technical 
                knowledge.</p>

            <p class="special"> For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people 
                (web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. 
                Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary 
                assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. 
                Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a 
                designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer, 
                back-end developer, and full-stack developer. </p>
